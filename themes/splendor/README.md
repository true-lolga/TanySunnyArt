## Social Media Menu ##

This theme uses a social media menu that's integrated with WordPress' custom menu system. To create a social media menu, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Dashboard and then go to Appearance > Menus. Create a new menu and name it whatever you'd like.

2. Select "Links" from the accordion menu on the left (where it says "Pages", "Links", and "Categories"), and in the text boxes marked "URL", enter your URL. For example, for Twitter, you would write https://twitter.com/your-twitter-username.

3. Click the "Add to Menu" button. Repeat for every social media network you'd like to add.

4. Once your menu is created, click the "Save Menu" button, and then click on the "Manage Locations" tab near the top of the screen. Assign your newly-created menu to the "Social Media Menu" location.

### Supported Networks ###

Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Vimeo, Tumblr, Instagram, Flickr, GitHub, Dribbble, CodePen, PollDaddy, Skype, Digg, Reddit, Dropbox. Unsupported social networks appear with a generic star icon.
